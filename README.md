This is a Sentiment Analysis project with the prediction of positive and negative reviews in a webapp using pickle.
The data from both positive and negative reviews are interpreted in a wordcloud, and the prediction is made using the Logistic regression model.
A confusion Matrix is also created for visualizing the predictive accuracy of the model.

It is my third task on my machine learning internship at Quantaverse AI
